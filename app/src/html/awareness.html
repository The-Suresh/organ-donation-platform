                        <h1>Awareness</h1>
                        <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
                        <p>The most crucial part of organ donation after it’s available is to instantly find a donor and securely transfer it. The introduction of machine-to-machine communication ensures fast actions without human interference. Blockchain is used for tracking transactions securely, maintaining data secrecy, and preventing fraud. Health services like e-government applications, TeleMedicine, and Artificial Intelligence have been reviewed.</p>
    
                        <p>Sharing patient data via smart contracts on blockchain increases efficiency and reduces costs by eliminating intermediaries. Blockchain creates verifiable, tamper-proof records, useful for organ transfers. According to NASSCOM, blockchain could create up to USD 5 billion value in India by 2023. Some states like Andhra Pradesh already use blockchain for property records.</p>
    
                        <h2>Organ Donation</h2>
                        <p>Organ donation is giving a part of the body (e.g., heart, lungs, kidney, liver) to someone with end-stage organ disease. Tissues like corneas, skin, and bone can also be donated.</p>
    
                        <h2>Legal Framework In India</h2>
                        <p>The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994 regulates organ donation. It allows deceased and living donors and identifies brain death. NOTTO oversees organ procurement and allocation. Despite India having the second-largest number of transplants globally (2019), donation rates are low due to lack of awareness, superstitions, and strict laws.</p>
    
                        <h1>Types of Donors</h1>
                        <p>Organ donors can be living or deceased. Types include:</p>
    
                        <h2>Living Donors</h2>
                        <p>Living donors may donate:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One kidney</li>
                            <li>Portion of the pancreas</li>
                            <li>Part of the liver</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Donors must be over 18 and usually related by blood or emotionally attached to the recipient.</p>
    
                        <h4>Types of Living Donors</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Living Near-Related Donors:</strong> Parents, siblings, children, grandparents, grandchildren, and spouse.</li>
                            <li><strong>Living Non-Near-Related Donors:</strong> Donate out of affection or special reasons.</li>
                            <li><strong>SWAP Donors:</strong> When donor-recipient pairs exchange organs due to incompatibility.</li>
                        </ul>
    
                        <h2>Deceased Donors</h2>
                        <p>Anyone can become a deceased donor after death (brainstem or cardiac). Consent from near relatives is necessary. Deceased donors can donate kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, pancreas, intestines, and tissues like corneas, bones, and skin.</p>
    
                        <h2>Organ Transplant</h2>
                        <p>Organ transplant replaces a failing organ with a healthy donor organ, such as the heart, lungs, kidneys, etc.</p>
    
                        <h2>Green Corridors</h2>
                        <p>Green corridors are routes cleared for ambulances transporting organs to minimize delivery time. They have been used effectively in cities like Chennai, Mumbai, and Bangalore. They enhance organ transplant success but require complex coordination. Usage of air ambulances or drones is being explored to avoid road traffic disruptions.</p>
    
                        <h4>Facts about Organ Donation</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Anyone can be an organ donor regardless of age, caste, or religion.</li>
                            <li>Medical criteria, not age, determine eligibility.</li>
                            <li>Tissues can be donated after natural death; vital organs after brain death.</li>
                            <li>Organ donation helps recipients return to normal lifestyles.</li>
                            <li>Minors need parental consent. Certain diseases can prevent living donation.</li>
                        </ul>
    
                        <h1>How Organ Donation Works</h1>
                        <p>Organ donation consists of six major phases:</p>
    
                        <h4>Phase 1: Organ Donation Sign-Up</h4>
                        <p>Individuals register to be organ donors via driving license applications or organ donor registries.</p>
    
                        <h4>Phase 2: Critical Care and Determination of Death</h4>
                        <p>Hospital staff attempt to save lives. Organ donation is only considered after confirmed brain death due to trauma, stroke, or aneurysm.</p>
    
                        <h4>Phase 3: Donor Identification and Consent</h4>
                        <p>The hospital contacts the local OPO. Consent is obtained from family if the patient isn’t already registered. Matching is based on blood type, tissue type, and urgency.</p>
    
                        <h4>Phase 4: Organ Transport</h4>
                        <p>Surgeons recover organs and tissues, which are quickly transported to the recipient's hospital using green corridors or air ambulances.</p>
    
                        <h4>Phase 5: Organ Transplant</h4>
                        <p>Once organs arrive, the transplantation surgery begins immediately.</p>
